## Exploring the System

- file  – Determine file type
- less – View file contents
- ls – List directory contents

    #### Having More Fun with ls
    | option | long option | description |
    |---|---|---|  
    | -a | --all | List all files, even those with names that begin with a period, which are normally not listed that is, hidden). |  
    | -A | --almost-all | Like the -a option above except it does not  list . (current directory) and .. (parent directory). |  
    | -d | --directory | Ordinarily, if a directory is specified, ls will list the contents of the directory, not the directory itself. Use this option in conjunction with the -l option to see details about the directory rather than its contents. |  
    | -F | --classify |  This option will append an indicator character to the end of each listed name. For example, a forward slash (/) if the name is a directory. |  
    | -h | --human-readable |   In long format listings, display file sizes in  human readable format rather than in bytes. |  
    | -l |  |   Display results in long format. |  
    | -r | --reverse |   Display the results in reverse order. Normally, ls displays its results in ascending alphabetical order. |  
    | -S |  |   Sort results by file size. |
    | -t |  |   Sort by modification time. |
