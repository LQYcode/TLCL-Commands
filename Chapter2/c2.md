# Chapter2 Navigation

## how to navigate the file system on Linux system

- cd  – Change directory
- pwd  – Print name of current working directory
- ls – List directory contents

    #### Some Helpful Shortcuts

	| shortcut | results |  
	|---|---|
	| cd | Changes the working directory to your home directory. |  
	| cd - | Changes the working directory to the previous working directory.  |    
	| cd  ~user_name | Changes the working directory to the home directory of user_name. For example, cd ~bob will change the directory to the home directory of user “bob.”  |
                      
## Exploring the System

- file  – Determine file type
- less – View file contents
- ls – List directory contents

    #### Having More Fun with ls
    | option | long option | description |
    |---|---|---|  
    | -a | --all | List all files, even those with names that begin with a period, which are normally not listed that is, hidden). |  
    | -A | --almost-all | Like the -a option above except it does not  list . (current directory) and .. (parent directory). |  
    | -d | --directory | Ordinarily, if a directory is specified, ls will list the contents of the directory, not the directory itself. Use this option in conjunction with the -l option to see details about the directory rather than its contents. |  
    | -F | --classify |  This option will append an indicator character to the end of each listed name. For example, a forward slash (/) if the name is a directory. |  
    | -h | --human-readable |   In long format listings, display file sizes in  human readable format rather than in bytes. |  
    | -l |  |   Display results in long format. |  
    | -r | --reverse |   Display the results in reverse order. Normally, ls displays its results in ascending alphabetical order. |  
    | -S |  |   Sort results by file size. |
    | -t |  |   Sort by modification time. |

    #### Table： ls Long Listing Fields
    | Field | meaning | 
    |---|---|
    | -rw-r--r-- | Access rights to the file. The first character indicates the type of file. Among the different types, a leading dash  means a regular file, while a “d” indicates a directory. The next three characters are the access rights for the file's owner, the next three are for members of the file's group, and the final three are for everyone else. |
    | 1 | File's number of hard links. See the sections "Symbolic Links" and "Hard Links" later in this chapter. | 
    | root | The username of the file's owner. | 
    | root | The name of the group that owns the file. | 
    | 3576296 | Size of the file in bytes. | 
    | 2017-04-03 11:05 | Date and time of the file's last modification. | 
    | Experience ubuntu.ogg | Name of the file. |
