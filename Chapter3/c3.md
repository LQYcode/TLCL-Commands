### mkdir – Create Directories
    `mkdir directory...`     
   **A note on notation**: When three periods follow an argument in the description of a command (as above), it means that the argument can be repeated, thus the following command:
   
   `mkdir dir1`
   
   would create a single directory named dir1
   
   `mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3`
      
   would create three directories named dir1, dir2, and dir3.
   
### cp – Copy Files and Directories
`cp item1 item2`

 copies the single file or directory item1 to the file or directory item2.
 
 `cp item... directory` 
    
 copies multiple items (either files or directories) into a directory.
 
 ####  cp Options
   | Options | Long Options | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|
   | -a | --archive | Copy the files and directories and all of their attributes, including ownerships and permissions. Normally, copies take on the default attributes of the user performing the copy. |
   | -i | --interactive | Before overwriting an existing file, prompt the user for confirmation. **If this option is not specified, cp will silently (meaning there will be no warning) overwrite files**. |
   | -r | --recursive | Recursively copy directories and their contents. This option (or the -a option) is required when copying directories. |
   | -u | --update | When copying files from one directory to another, only copy files that either don't exist or are newer than the existing corresponding files, in the destination directory. This is useful when copying large numbers of files as it skips files that don't need to be copied. |
   | -v | --verbose |  Display informative messages as the copy is performed. |
   

### mv – Move and Rename Files
`mv item1 item2`

to move or rename the file or directory item1 to item2.

`mv item... directory`

to move one or more items from one directory to another.

####  mv Options
   | Options | Long Options | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|
   | -i | --interactive | Before overwriting an existing file, prompt the user for confirmation. If this option is not specified, mv will silently overwrite files. |
   | -u | --update | When moving files from one directory to another, only move files that either don't exist, or are newer than the existing corresponding files in the destination directory. |
   | -v | --verbose |  Display informative messages as the move is performed. |
