### mkdir – Create Directories
    `mkdir directory...`     
   **A note on notation**: When three periods follow an argument in the description of a command (as above), it means that the argument can be repeated, thus the following command:
   
   `mkdir dir1`
   
   would create a single directory named dir1
   
   `mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3`
      
   would create three directories named dir1, dir2, and dir3.
   
### cp – Copy Files and Directories
`cp item1 item2`

 copies the single file or directory item1 to the file or directory item2.
 
 `cp item... directory` 
    
 copies multiple items (either files or directories) into a directory.
 
 ####  cp Options
   | Options | Long Options | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|
   | -a | --archive | Copy the files and directories and all of their attributes, including ownerships and permissions. Normally, copies take on the default attributes of the user performing the copy. |
   | -i | --interactive | Before overwriting an existing file, prompt the user for confirmation. **If this option is not specified, cp will silently (meaning there will be no warning) overwrite files**. |
   | -r | --recursive | Recursively copy directories and their contents. This option (or the -a option) is required when copying directories. |
   | -u | --update | When copying files from one directory to another, only copy files that either don't exist or are newer than the existing corresponding files, in the destination directory. This is useful when copying large numbers of files as it skips files that don't need to be copied. |
   | -v | --verbose |  Display informative messages as the copy is performed. |
   

### mv – Move and Rename Files
`mv item1 item2`

to move or rename the file or directory item1 to item2.

`mv item... directory`

to move one or more items from one directory to another.

####  mv Options
   | Options | Long Options | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|
   | -i | --interactive | Before overwriting an existing file, prompt the user for confirmation. If this option is not specified, mv will silently overwrite files. |
   | -u | --update | When moving files from one directory to another, only move files that either don't exist, or are newer than the existing corresponding files in the destination directory. |
   | -v | --verbose |  Display informative messages as the move is performed. |
   
   
### rm – Remove Files and Directories
`rm item...`

where **item** is one or more files or directories.

   ####  rm Options
   | Options | Long Options | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|
   | -i | --interactive | Before deleting an existing file, prompt the user for confirmation. **If this option is not specified, rm will silently delete files**. |
   | -r | --recursive | Recursively delete directories. This means that if a directory being deleted has subdirectories,  delete them too. To delete a directory, this option must be specified. |
   | -f | --force | Ignore nonexistent files and do not prompt. This overrides the --_interactive_ option. |
   | -v | --verbose | Display informative messages as the deletion is performed. |
   
   `Here is a useful tip: whenever you use wildcards with rm (besides carefully
    checking your typing!), test the wildcard first with ls. This will let you see the
    files that will be deleted. Then press the up arrow key to recall the command and
    replace ls with rm.`


### ln – Create Links
The ln command is used to create either hard or symbolic links. It is used in one of two ways.
   `ln file link`
    creates a hard link.
    
    `ln -s item link`
   creates a symbolic link

    ` mv fun dir1`  
    ` mv dir1 dir2` 
    ` mv dir2/dir1 .`   
    ` mv dir1/fun .`    
    
    ` ln fun fun-hard`  
    ` ln fun  dir1/fun-hard`    
    ` ln fun  dir2/fun-hard`

  #### Creating Symbolic Links
    
  `ln -s fun fun-sym`   
  ` ln -s ../fun dir1/fun-sym`  
  ` ln -s ../fun dir2/fun-sym`  
  ` ln -s /home/me/playground/fun dir1/fun-sym` 
  ` ln -s dir1 dir1-sym`    
  
 #### Removing Files and Directories
    ` rm fun-hard`  
   ` rm -i fun` 
   ` less fun-sym`  
   ` rm fun-sym dir1-sym`   
   ` rm -r playground`
