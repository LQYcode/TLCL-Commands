  - sort – Sort lines of text   
  - uniq – Report or omit repeated lines    
  - grep – Print lines matching a pattern   
  - wc – Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file 
  - head – Output the first part of a file  
  - tail – Output the last part of a file   
  - tee – Read from standard input and write to standard output and files   
  
  ## Redirecting Standard Output    
  
  I/O redirection allows us to redefine where standard output goes. To redirect standard
  output to another file instead of the screen, we use the > redirection operator followed by
  the name of the file. Why would we want to do this? It's often useful to store the output of
  a command in a file. For example, we could tell the shell to send the output of the ls
  command to the file ls-output.txt instead of the screen:
  `ls -l /usr/bin > ls-output.txt`
